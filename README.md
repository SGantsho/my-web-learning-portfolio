# my-web-learning-portfolio
This repository showcases my front-end development projects, including a bookstore page, audio/video player, cafe menu, business card layout, and a stylized to-do list. These projects demonstrate semantic HTML structure, responsive layout techniques, and progressive improvement in CSS styling.
